# Magnetometer Calibration

This was supposed to be a port of the magnetometer calibration software [Magneto](https://sites.google.com/view/sailboatinstruments1) since one of our sensor programmers at CanBee did not have access to a Windows device for a while.

I stopped the work later on because it turned out we did not need to use a magnetometer after all and turned this repo into a C/D/Zig comparison thing.
